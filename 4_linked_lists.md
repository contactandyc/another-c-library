# Linked Lists

## A Data Structure Interface

We will explore the singly linked list, the doubly linked list, binary search trees, and finally the red black tree.  Each of these build upon each other in complexity and can actually share a similar interface.  The code and interfaces are meant more for the purpose of understanding and to show various optimizations along the way.  A linked list and binary search trees allow for inserting, finding, erasing, and iteration.

This code that follows is found in illustrations/linked_structures/1_singly_linked_list<br/>
If you change to that directory, you will find the following Makefile.  

```Makefile
DATA_STRUCTURE=singly_linked_list

all: test_data_structure examples

test_data_structure: test_data_structure.c data_structure.h $(DATA_STRUCTURE).c
	gcc test_data_structure.c $(DATA_STRUCTURE).c -o test_data_structure -DDATA_STRUCTURE=\"$(DATA_STRUCTURE)\"

examples:
	@./test_data_structure AB CAB ABCDEF AFCEDB

clean:
	rm -f test_data_structure *~
```

When you run
```bash
make
```

The first block with a colon will be run.  In this Makefile, it is the following line.
```Makefile
all: test_data_structure examples
```

The all group simply refers to other groups to be built.  In this case it is test_data_structure and examples.
```Makefile
test_data_structure: test_data_structure.c data_structure.h $(DATA_STRUCTURE).c
	gcc test_data_structure.c $(DATA_STRUCTURE).c -o test_data_structure -DDATA_STRUCTURE=\"$(DATA_STRUCTURE)\"

examples:
	@./test_data_structure AB CAB ABCDEF AFCEDB
```

The lines of code after test_data_structure will run if the file called test_data_structure is older than the files after the colon.  If you edit test_data_structure.c, data_structure.h or singly_linked_list.h (same as $(DATA_STRUCTURE).h), the program will be built using the following line of code.  $(DATA_STRUCTURE) is converted to singly_linked_list.  The output is test_data_structure.
```Makefile
gcc test_data_structure.c $(DATA_STRUCTURE).c -o test_data_structure -DDATA_STRUCTURE=\"$(DATA_STRUCTURE)\"
```

If you didn't want to use a Makefile to build test_data_structure, you could do so from the command line using the following command.

```bash
gcc test_data_structure.c singly_linked_list.c -o test_data_structure -DDATA_STRUCTURE=\"singly_linked_list\"
```

The examples block will run everytime because it doesn't have any dependencies and examples isn't a file that exists.  If you were to create a file called examples, then the examples block would cease to run.  The @ symbol prevents the command from being printed to the screen.  By running <b>make</b>, you will effectively build test_data_structure if it needs built and run the examples block.  Running <b>make clean</b> will clean up the binary.  You can run any block by specifying it.  <b>make all</b> is equivalent to running <b>make</b> as <b>make</b> runs the first block.  If you just want to run the examples block, you can by running <b>make examples</b>.  

Go ahead and read the code in illustrations/3_linked_structures/1_singly_linked_list and then continue with this book.  The code is inlined in the book as well, but it never hurts to read code and try and understand it.  To illustrate how red black trees work, it makes sense to understand linked lists and binary search trees well first.  A great way to understand code is to have something which you can build, change, and experiment with.  This first example is obviously a bit more involved than the typical hello world program.  However, it provides the basis for understanding more complicated work and is about as simple as I can make it.

If you run <b>make</b> you will get the following output.

```
$ make
gcc test_data_structure.c singly_linked_list.c -o test_data_structure -DDATA_STRUCTURE=\"singly_linked_list\"
Creating singly_linked_list for AB
root -> B -> A -> NULL
print_using_iteration: BA

Creating singly_linked_list for CAB
root -> B -> A -> C -> NULL
print_using_iteration: BAC

Creating singly_linked_list for ABCDEF
root -> F -> E -> D -> C -> B -> A -> NULL
print_using_iteration: FEDCBA

Creating singly_linked_list for AFCEDB
root -> B -> D -> E -> C -> F -> A -> NULL
print_using_iteration: BDECFA
```

After the code is built, <b>./test_data_structure AB CAB ABCDEF AFCEDB</b> is run which creates 4 linked lists based upon the arguments passed in.  The output shows how the input transforms into a linked list with arrows (->) for pointers and letters for each node.  The linked lists will place the items in reverse order (notice that BA becomes root -> A -> B -> NULL).  root is just a pointer and not a node.  In order for your data structure to be accessible, you must have a reference to it.  NULL is to indicate that B doesn't point to a node.  This doesn't have to be the case, but to show off linked lists, its good to know the 2 instruction insertion method which is demonstrated below.  

The primary goal is to build a red black tree with an interface that looks something like the following (it'll change once we address production concerns).  The data_structure.h is an interface that can be used for singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, binary search trees, and the red black tree.  The interface or header file below separates the implementation from the definition.  The definition is the only thing that test_data_structure.c (later) will be able to work with.  When building larger software packages, defining clean interfaces can greatly reduce complexity.

data_structure.h
```c
#ifndef _data_structure_H
#define _data_structure_H

#include "stla_common.h"

struct node_s;
typedef struct node_s node_t;

/*
  You may or may not want to have methods like node_init, node_key, node_print,
  and node_destroy.  My purpose in having them is to provide a uniform interface
  for test_data_structure.  This is only an interface for testing.
*/
node_t *node_init(char key);
void node_destroy(node_t *n);
char node_key(node_t *n);
void node_print(node_t *root);

/*
  Given a data structure, find a node given a pointer to the root node and the
  key of interest.
*/
node_t *node_find(char key, node_t *root);

/*
  If the key doesn't exist, an insert a node into the data structure.  The
  node_to_insert has already been initialized by the client application (most
  likely through node_init).  The node's physical location in memory will not
  change as a result of inserting or erasing nodes.  Because the root might
  change, a pointer to the root is passed to node_insert.
*/
bool node_insert(node_t *node_to_insert, node_t **root);

/*
  Once finding a node, erase the node from the data structure.  The
  node_to_erase is typically found through node_find.  The pointer to root is
  passed to node_erase as the root might change.  node_erase doesn't free
  resources used by node_to_erase.  It only unlinks it from the data structure.
*/
bool node_erase(node_t *node_to_erase, node_t **root);

/* Iteration
  All of the linked structures will support first and next.
  Some can support last and previous as well.
*/
bool node_previous_supported();
node_t *node_first(node_t *root);
node_t *node_last(node_t *root);
node_t *node_next(node_t *n);
node_t *node_previous(node_t *n);

/*
  To destroy a data structure, you will need to use the following pattern...
  node_t *n = node_first_to_erase(root);
  while(n) {
    node_t *next = node_next_to_erase(n);
    node_destroy(n);
    n = next;
  }

  Notice that a temporary link to the next node to erase is saved prior to
  destroying the node.  For binary search trees, the beginning to the end
  isn't the same as a sorted order.  It's known as postorder iteration.  Post
  order iteration can be useful for fast construction and destruction of binary
  search trees.  By having an alternate iterator for destruction, we can have
  one interface which works for a number of data structure types.
*/
node_t *node_first_to_erase(node_t *root);
node_t *node_next_to_erase(node_t *n);

#endif
```

In C, you can specify a struct without indicating how it is defined in a header file.  The details can be hidden in the implementation or declared later.  By declaring the structure in this way, outside applications won't be able to access members of the struct.  I generally try and hide implementation details in the implementation and provide as minimal interface as possible.
```c
struct node_s;
typedef struct node_s node_t;
```

The rest of the functions were commented inline above.

## The Data Structure Interface Test Driver

In addition to having a common interface, I have created a set of functions to test the data structure.  The set of functions will include data_structure.h and test that the code is doing what it is supposed to do and show how to use the interface.

```c
#include "data_structure.h"

#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

/*
  arg contains a number of characters (or letters).  Each letter is inserted
  into the data structure assuming that it hasn't already been inserted.
  The characters are inserted in the order that they are found within the
  string.  Because this is a tool to test the data structure, I also test that
  if an insert should work, that it does work.  Once the insert succeeds, test
  if the item can be found.  After all of the inserts are done, the root of
  the data structure is returned.
*/
node_t *fill_data_structure(const char *arg) {
  node_t *root = NULL;
  const char *s = arg;
  while (*s != 0) {
    if (!node_find(*s, root)) {
      node_t *n = node_init(*s);
      if (!node_insert(n, &root)) {
        printf("Find failed for %c and insert failed as well!\n", *s);
        abort();
      }
      if (!node_find(*s, root)) {
        printf("Find failed for %c after insert succeeded!\n", *s);

      }

  }

The code is commented above (it's a good idea to begin reading code from the
main function.

The include order is important.  If you place data_structure.h after the standard includes, you might mask an error where data_structure.h doesn't include all of its dependencies properly.
```c
#include "data_structure.h"

#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
```

# The Singly Linked List

In the previous section, we implemented a basic interface.  Below is the implementation of the singly-linked list.

```c
#include "data_structure.h"

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct node_s {
  struct node_s *next;
  char key;
};

node_t *node_init(char key) {
  node_t *n = (node_t *)malloc(sizeof(node_t));
  n->next = NULL;
  n->key = key;
  return n;
}

void node_destroy(node_t *n) { free(n); }

char node_key(node_t *n) { return n->key; }

node_t *node_find(char key, node_t *root) {
  while (root) {
    if (key == root->key)
      return root;
    root = root->next;
  }
  return NULL;
}

bool node_insert(node_t *node_to_insert, node_t **root) {
  node_to_insert->next = *root;
  *root = node_to_insert;
  return true;
}

void node_print(node_t *n) {
  printf("root");
  while (n) {
    printf(" -> %c", n->key);
    n = n->next;
  }
  printf(" -> NULL");
  printf("\n");
}

bool node_erase(node_t *node_to_erase, node_t **root) {
  node_t *prev = NULL;
  while(n != node_to_erase) { // no end of list check
    prev = n;
    n = n->next; // this will cause the program to crash if n is NULL (which is what we are doing anyways)
  }
  if(prev)
    prev->next = n->next;
  else
    *root = n->next;
  return true;
}

node_t *node_first(node_t *n) { return n; }

node_t *node_last(node_t *n) {
  node_t *prev = n;
  while(n) {
    prev = n;
    n = n->next;
  }
  return prev;
}

node_t *node_next(node_t *n) { return n->next; }

bool node_previous_supported() { return false; }

node_t *node_previous(node_t *n) { return NULL; }

node_t *node_first_to_erase(node_t *n) { return n; }

node_t *node_next_to_erase(node_t *n) { return n->next; }
```

Singly linked lists have a single link or pointer connecting one node to the next.  The pointer is often called next, but can really be anything.  Because the structure is hidden inside the implementation, there are functions to initialize and destroy the object.  node_key is also needed to get the key member for the same reason.  
```c
struct node_s {
  struct node_s *next;
  char key;
};

node_t *node_init(char key) {
  node_t *n = (node_t *)malloc(sizeof(node_t));
  n->next = NULL;
  n->key = key;
  return n;
}

void node_destroy(node_t *n) { free(n); }

char node_key(node_t *n) { return n->key; }
```

Insertion into a singly linked list is a very fast operation typically requiring two lines of code.  1.  Associate the link on the node to insert to the root node.  2.  Set the root node pointer to point to the node to insert.
```c
bool node_insert(node_t *node_to_insert, node_t **root) {
  node_to_insert->next = *root; // line 1
  *root = node_to_insert;       // line 2
  return true;
}
```

Iterating through a linked list might look like the following..
```c
void iterate_through_linked_list(node_t *n) {
  while(n) {
    // do something
    n = n->next;
  }
}
```

To iterate through a linked list looking for a particular match, you would do the following.
```c
node_t *node_find(char key, node_t *root) {
  while (root) {
    if (key == root->key)
      return root;
    root = root->next;
  }
  return NULL;
}
```

With lists, the root node is the first node.  With binary search trees, the first node is the left most node.
```c
node_t *node_first(node_t *n) { return n; }
```

```c
node_t *node_next(node_t *n) { return n->next; }
```

For the singly linked list, going backwards doesn't work, so node_previous_supported should return false and node_previous should return NULL
```c
bool node_previous_supported() { return false; }

node_t *node_previous(node_t *n) { return NULL; }
```

While singly linked lists don't have the ability to go backwards due to a lack of a previous pointer, you can keep track of the last node as you iterate through the list.  This can be useful for finding the last node in a list or erasing a node.
```c
node_t *node_last(node_t *n) {
  node_t *prev = n;
  while(n) {
    prev = n;
    n = n->next;
  }
  return prev;
}
```

Erasing a node follows a similar approach to node_last, except the while(n) statement will also test to see if n matches the node to erase.
```c
bool node_erase(node_t *node_to_erase, node_t **root) {
  node_t *prev = NULL;
  while(n && n != node_to_erase) {
    prev = n;
    n = n->next;
  }
```

Once the while loop has finished, if n is not NULL, then it must match the node_to_erase.  There are two conditions in the case that remain.  If prev is NULL, then the node to erase is at the head or root of the list.  In this case, link the root to the node that the current node to erase links to.  Otherwise, link the prev->next pointer to n's next pointer.  Finally, return true.  If n was NULL, then return false.  It is most likely that n will not be NULL (otherwise we wouldn't have the node to erase in the first place).  Because of this, I choose to have this condition first.
```c
  if(n) {
    if(prev)
      prev->next = n->next;
    else
      *root = n->next;
    return true;
  }
  abort(); // this should never happen!
  return false;
}
```

A slightly less performant approach where we test for n being NULL first, reduces nesting.  I use both approaches in practice (and sometimes don't test for n at all).
```c
  if(!n) abort();
  if(prev)
    prev->next = n->next;
  else
    *root = n->next;
  return true;
}
```

We could even consider implementing the code assuming that node_to_erase must exist like the following.  Because I'm choosing to abort if n is NULL due to incorrect usage, the version below is what ultimately ended up in our code.  This code would abort if n was NULL anyways in the while loop if the node_to_erase didn't exist.
```c
bool node_erase(node_t *node_to_erase, node_t **root) {
  node_t *prev = NULL;
  while(n != node_to_erase) { // no end of list check
    prev = n;
    n = n->next; // this will cause the program to crash if n is NULL (which is what we are doing anyways)
  }
  if(prev)
    prev->next = n->next; // this will cause a crash if n is not found
  else
    *root = n->next; // this will cause a crash if n is not found
  return true;
}
```

Finally, it is fine for linked lists to use the first to last order for destroying the list.  node_first_to_erase and node_next_to_erase are similar to node_first and node_next respectively.
```c
node_t *node_first_to_erase(node_t *n) { return n; }

node_t *node_next_to_erase(node_t *n) { return n->next; }
```

Now that we are through the code, if you haven't done it, you can run <b>make</b> in illustrations/linked_structures/1_singly_linked_list.  The output should look like the following.

```
$ make
gcc test_data_structure.c singly_linked_list.c -o test_data_structure -DDATA_STRUCTURE=\"singly_linked_list\"
Creating singly_linked_list for AB
root -> B -> A -> NULL
print_using_iteration: BA

Creating singly_linked_list for CAB
root -> B -> A -> C -> NULL
print_using_iteration: BAC

Creating singly_linked_list for ABCDEF
root -> F -> E -> D -> C -> B -> A -> NULL
print_using_iteration: FEDCBA

Creating singly_linked_list for AFCEDB
root -> B -> D -> E -> C -> F -> A -> NULL
print_using_iteration: BDECFA
```

You might notice that the linked lists are reversed.  This is because we are using the two line insert technique and putting items at the front of the list.  When using singly linked lists, it is common to maintain a head (or root) and a tail pointer.  The tail refers to the last node or NULL if the list is empty.  By maintaining a tail, one can efficiently insert items at the end of the list.  If you don't maintain a tail and still wish to insert items at the end of the list, you can do that by skipping to the last node and then linking to your new node from the last node.

# The Doubly Linked List

Doubly linked lists introduce link nodes in both directions.  A doubly linked list will have a next and a previous pointer (the naming is up to you).  For example, in the case of a doubly linked list for B -> A -> C, the following would hold true.  We will denote a link starting from a node with a - and the direction being > next or < previous.  You can think of the linkage like the following illustrations.

```
B -> A, B -< NULL (B links to A for next pointer and NULL for previous pointer)
A -> C, A -< B (A links to C for next pointer and B for previous pointer)
C -> NULL, C -< A (C links to NULL for next pointer and A for previous pointer)
```

Next pointers are the same as singly linked list.
```
root -> B -> A -> C -> NULL
```

Previous pointers are new.  Note that B (the root or head node) doesn't point back to the root pointer.  The root pointer is not a node.  It is just a way of remembering where the data structure lives in memory (as its a pointer to the first node).
```
NULL <- B <- A <- C
```

The full code for the doubly linked list is found in illustrations/linked_structures/2_doubly_linked_list.  The code is identical with the following exceptions in doubly_linked_list.c (name changed from singly_linked_list.c) and the Makefile where the DATA_STRUCTURE constant changed to doubly_linked_list.

The node_s struct changes from
```c
struct node_s {
  struct node_s *next;
  char key;
};
```

To the following to include a previous pointer.
```c
struct node_s {
  struct node_s *next;
  struct node_s *previous;
  char key;
};
```

The node_previous_supported and node_previous are changed from
```c
bool node_previous_supported() { return false; }

node_t *node_previous(node_t *n) { return NULL; }
```

To the following because there is now a method for iterating through previous elements.
```c
bool node_previous_supported() { return true; }

node_t *node_previous(node_t *n) { return n->previous; }
```

The node_init method needs to change from
```c
node_t *node_init(char key) {
  node_t *n = (node_t *)malloc(sizeof(node_t));
  n->next = NULL;
  n->key = key;
  return n;
}
```

To the following to initialize the previous member.  It is possibly more efficient to assign multiple variables of the same type to a single value when you are able as I do in the <b>n->next = n->previous = NULL;</b> line below.
```c
node_t *node_init(char key) {
  node_t *n = (node_t *)malloc(sizeof(node_t));
  n->next = n->previous = NULL;
  n->key = key;
  return n;
}
```

The insert method will change from
```c
bool node_insert(node_t *node_to_insert, node_t **root) {
  node_to_insert->next = *root;
  *root = node_to_insert;
  return true;
}
```

To the following to initialize the previous pointer properly.  After the node_to_insert is added to the root or head, if there was a previous node at the root, then link that node's previous pointer to the node_to_insert.
```c
bool node_insert(node_t *node_to_insert, node_t **root) {
  node_to_insert->next = *root;
  if (node_to_insert->next)
    node_to_insert->next->previous = node_to_insert;
  *root = node_to_insert;
  return true;
}
```

The erase method will change from
```c
bool node_erase(node_t *node_to_erase, node_t **root) {
  node_t *prev = NULL;
  while (n != node_to_erase) { // no end of list check
    prev = n;
    n = n->next; // this will cause the program to crash if n is NULL (which is
                 // what we are doing anyways)
  }
  if (prev)
    prev->next = n->next;
  else
    *root = n->next;
  return true;
}
```

To the following because we don't need to find the node prior to the given node to erase the node.  The previous pointer already exists on the node, so we can unlink or erase the node from the data structure simply by relinking the nodes that are before (previous) and after (next) to the given node.  

If there is a previous node to the node to erase (n), then link the previous node's next pointer to the same value as n's next pointer.  If n's next pointer is not NULL, then link the next node's previous pointer to n's previous pointer.

If there is not a previous node to the node to erase (n), then the node that is being erased is the first node in the list.  Reset the root pointer to point the same value as n's next pointer.  If n has a non NULL next pointer (it isn't the only node in the list), then link the node that is pointed to by n's next pointer to NULL as the node that is pointed to by n's next pointer has become the new root or head of the list.
```c
bool node_erase(node_t *n, node_t **root) {
  if (n->previous) {
    n->previous->next = n->next;
    if (n->next)
      n->next->previous = n->previous;
  } else {
    *root = n->next;
    if (n->next)
      n->next->previous = NULL;
  }
  return true;
}
```

The last function that changed is the node_print method.  node_print is changed to print two lines.  The first line is the same as the singly linked list in that it shows next pointers.  The second line shows previous pointers.  The second line is only printed if the list is not empty.
```c
void node_print(node_t *np) {
  node_t *n = np;
  printf("root");
  while (n) {
    printf(" -> %c", n->key);
    n = n->next;
  }
  printf(" -> NULL");
  printf("\n");
  if (np) {
    n = np;
    printf("NULL");
    while (n) {
      printf(" <- %c", n->key);
      n = n->next;
    }
    printf("\n");
  }
}
```

Next up is a brief explanation of threads, and then we will use what we've learned to create a very useful allocation object.  In this chapter, I began relaxing how much I'm explaining.  A very important skill is to learn to read code (regardless of how hard it is to read).  As this book progresses, there will be less in the way of explanations.
