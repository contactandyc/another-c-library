The red-black tree is a mostly balanced binary search tree that was invented by Leonidas J. Guibas and Robert Sedgewick.

## The properties of a red-black tree

Red–black tree Properties (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red–black\_tree)

1. Each node is either red or black.
2. The root is black.
3. All leaves (NIL) are black.
4. If a node is red, then both its children are black.
5. Every path from a given node to any of its descendant NIL nodes contains the same number of black nodes.

My additional rules for clarification which are based upon the first 5 rules.
- If a node has one child, the child must be red
- If a node has two children, one or both of the children can be red if the parent is black
- If a node is red, it must have either two children who are black or no children at all.
- The parent of a red node must be black
- The black height of any leaf node must be the same (another way of stating 5)
- A red-black tree often will have many more black nodes than red nodes.  This is okay and expected.  The red node is an indication that the tree may be somehow out of balance.  It is possible to have more red nodes than black nodes, but it isn't typical.
- A red-black tree has a worst case of a 2logN depth but is likely to maintain a logN depth or be very close to it.

The red-black tree is balanced through rotations and changing colors, which was discussed in [Balancing Binary Search Trees](../11-balancing-binary-search-trees/index.md).  Make sure the tree\_operations tool is built from the last section if you want to follow along.

Most of the code is in red\_black\_tree.c

## Testing the red-black tree properties

When an algorithm can be tested through a function, it is often a good idea to write such a function.  Functions like the one to follow should be pretty straight-forward, given the rules above.

```c
bool test_red_black_rules(ac_pool_t *pool, node_t *root) {
  /* an empty tree is valid */
  if(!root)
    return true;
  bool success = true;
  /* the root is black */
  if(root->color != BLACK) {
    success = false;
    printf( "The root is not black!\n" );
  }
  node_t *n = node_first(root);
  int black_nodes = 0;
  node_t *first_black_leaf = NULL;
  node_t *sn = n;
  while(n) {
    if(!n->left && !n->right) { /* only consider leaf nodes */
      black_nodes = count_black_nodes(n);
      first_black_leaf = n;
      break;
    }
    n = node_next(n);
  }
  n = sn;
  while(n) {
    /* check if one child and that child is red */
    if(!n->left) {
      if(n->right) {
        int bn = count_black_nodes(n);
        if(bn != black_nodes) {
          success = false;
          print_node_with_color(n);
          printf( " has a NULL left child with a different black height than " );
          print_node_with_color(first_black_leaf);
          printf( "\n");
        }
      }
    }
    else if(!n->right) {
      int bn = count_black_nodes(n);
      if(bn != black_nodes) {
        success = false;
        print_node_with_color(n);
        printf( " has a NULL right child with a different black height than " );
        print_node_with_color(first_black_leaf);
        printf( "\n");
      }
    }

    if(n->left && !n->right && n->left->color != RED) {
      success = false;
      print_node_with_color(n);
      printf( " has one left child and it isn't red\n" );
    }
    if(!n->left && n->right && n->right->color != RED) {
      success = false;
      print_node_with_color(n);
      printf( " has one right child and it isn't red\n" );
    }
    if(n->color == RED) {
      if(n->left && n->left->color == RED) {
        success = false;
        print_node_with_color(n);
        printf( " has a red left child and is red\n" );
      }
      if(n->right && n->right->color == RED) {
        success = false;
        print_node_with_color(n);
        printf( " has a red right child and is red\n" );
      }
      if(n->parent && n->parent->color == RED) {
        success = false;
        print_node_with_color(n);
        printf( " has a red parent and is red\n" );
      }
    }
    if(!n->left && !n->right) { /* only consider leaf nodes */
      int bn = count_black_nodes(n);
      if(black_nodes != bn) {
        success = false;
        print_node_with_color(n);
        printf( " has a different black height than " );
        print_node_with_color(first_black_leaf);
        printf( "\n");
      }
    }
    n = node_next(n);
  }
  return success;
}
```

## Insert

The red-black tree functions, in many ways, are similar to the binary search tree.  Iterating and finding are the same.  Erasing and inserting are done in virtually the same way, except once an item is inserted or erased, the color must be fixed.  The difference between the binary search tree and red-black tree node\_insert is shown below.

binary\_search\_tree.c
```c
bool node_insert(node_t *node_to_insert, node_t **root) {
  node_t **n = root, *parent = NULL;
  while (*n) {
    parent = *n;
    if (node_to_insert->key < parent->key)
      n = &(parent->left);
    else if (node_to_insert->key > parent->key)
      n = &(parent->right);
    else
      return false;
  }

  node_to_insert->parent = parent;
  node_to_insert->left = node_to_insert->right = NULL;
  *n = node_to_insert;
  return true;
}
```

red\_black\_tree.c
```c
void red_black_insert(node_t *node, node_t **root);

bool node_insert(node_t *node_to_insert, node_t **root) {
  node_t **n = root, *parent = NULL;
  while (*n) {
    parent = *n;
    if (node_to_insert->key < parent->key)
      n = &(parent->left);
    else if (node_to_insert->key > parent->key)
      n = &(parent->right);
    else
      return false;
  }

  node_to_insert->parent = parent;
  node_to_insert->left = node_to_insert->right = NULL;
  *n = node_to_insert;
  red_black_insert(node_to_insert, root);
  return true;
}
```

The difference is:

red\_black\_tree.c
```c
void red_black_insert(node_t *node, node_t **root);
...
red_black_insert(node_to_insert, root);
```

The red\_black\_insert method in red\_black\_tree.c
```c
void red_black_insert(node_t *node, node_t **root) {
  node->color = RED;
  node_t *parent, *grandparent, *uncle;

  while (true) {
    parent = node->parent;
    if(!parent) {
      node->parent = NULL;
      node->color = BLACK;
      break;
    }

    if(parent->color == BLACK)
      break;

    grandparent = parent->parent;
    if(grandparent->left == parent) {
      uncle = grandparent->right;
      if(uncle && uncle->color == RED) {
        // recolor grandparent
        grandparent->color = RED;
        parent->color = uncle->color = BLACK;
        node = grandparent;
        continue;
      }

      if(parent->right == node)
        rotate_left(parent, NULL);
      rotate_right_and_swap_colors(grandparent, root);
      break;
    }
    else {
      uncle = grandparent->left;
      if(uncle && uncle->color == RED) {
        // recolor grandparent
        grandparent->color = RED;
        parent->color = uncle->color = BLACK;
        node = grandparent;
        continue;
      }

      if(parent->left == node)
        rotate_right(parent, NULL);
      rotate_left_and_swap_colors(grandparent, root);
      break;
    }
  }
}
```

It is assumed that node is linked into its proper parent and that the node is a leaf node with left and right pointers set to NULL.  The red-black tree always initially paints the given node red.
```c
void red_black_insert(node_t *node, node_t **root) {
  node->color = RED;
```

The insert operation will need to look at the parent, the grandparent, and the uncle (the sibling of the parent).  Declare these variables for later use.
```c
  node_t *parent, *grandparent, *uncle;
```

The red-black tree insert may need to recurse.  Many recursion problems (this one included) can be written as a loop.  The loop will continue forever until a break is called.  
```c
while (true) {
  parent = node->parent;
```

At this point in the code, the node is always red.

The first check is to see if the given node is the root node.  If the node doesn't have a parent, it is a root node.  Root nodes are colored black, and then we are done (break out of the while loop).    
```c
  if(!parent) {
    node->parent = NULL;
    node->color = BLACK;
    break;
  }
```

If the parent is black, we are done as having a red leaf following a black parent is always valid.
```c
  if(parent->color == BLACK)
    break;
```

The parent is valid, and it must be red (as it must be red or black, and it was determined to not be black in the last block of code).  It is a violation of the red-black tree to have two red nodes in a row.  Get the grandparent (the parent's parent).
```c
  grandparent = parent->parent;
```

The red-black tree insert operation considers the node's uncle's color.  The uncle would be the grandparent's other child.  If the grandparent->left == parent, then the uncle is the right node.  Otherwise, the uncle is the left node.  The else block is a mirror of the if block, switching every instance of left with right.
```c
  if(grandparent->left == parent) {
    uncle = grandparent->right;
    ...
  }
  else {
    uncle = grandparent->left;
    ...
  }
```

The next case to test is if the uncle exists and the uncle's color is red.  At this point, the parent and the uncle are both red.  The red-black tree needs to maintain a constant black height.

(i)nsert, (e)rase, (r)ight_rotate, (l)eft_rotate, (R)ed, (b)lack, re(c)olor, (h)elp, (q)uit
```

Before inserting node (A2), notice that the leaf nodes (B2), (E2), and G2 all have a black height of 2, meaning that there are only 2 black nodes in the path from the root to each of the leaf nodes.  If you recolor (B2) and (E2) black and change D2 to be red, it doesn't change the black height of any of the leaf nodes.

In the tool, you can type:
```
c D
```

to recolor and get the following partial output
```
F1
| \
|  G2
|    
(D1)
|   \
B2   E2
|      
(A2)
```

Notice that in this case, the recoloring created a valid red-black tree.  The black height is 2 to every leaf node.  The root is black.  There are no consecutive red nodes.  In the one case (A2) where a node only has a single child, the child is red.

To recap, if the parent and uncle are red, paint the parent and uncle black and the grandparent red.  However, the grandparent's parent possibly was also red.  To handle this case, we can repeat all of the tests recursively. Since the recursion is simple, continuing in a while loop works by changing the node to the grandparent. The grandparent which painted red to maintain the rule that the loop always starts with a red node.  The code is below:
```c
  if(grandparent->left == parent) {
    uncle = grandparent->right;
    if(uncle && uncle->color == RED) {
      grandparent->color = RED;
      parent->color = uncle->color = BLACK;
      node = grandparent;
      continue;
    }
```

The following example adds the letter 0 (zero) to the left of (A2).  This creates the same case as above, but when recoloring happens (c B), (B1) and (D1) are both red. D becomes the new node. It is an example where recoloring creates a parent and child which are both red.

This is illustrated with the tool below.

(D1) has a red left child and is red
```

The next case is if the uncle is black or NULL, then rotate to the right around the grandparent.  

The code is below:
```c
  if(parent->right == node)
    rotate_left(parent, NULL);
  rotate_right_and_swap_colors(grandparent, root);
  break;
```

If the node being inserted is to the right of the parent, it needs to be rotated to the left to keep one child to either side after the rotation.  If the left rotate isn't done first, the following will happen:

```
$ $ac/bin/tree_operations FDGB

B2
  \
   (D2)
   |   
   (C2)

(C2) has a red parent and is red
(D2) has a red left child and is red
```

This just created the inverse problem (D is to the right and C is to the left of D).  

Notice that while swapping colors during the rotate, that the placement of the black node doesn't change. This maintains the proper black height.

After inserting A, do a right rotation on its grandparent D because its uncle is NULL (NULL is black).

In the example below, C is inserted to the left of B.  Both C and B are red.  Left rotate around B (the parent) before right rotating through D (the grandparent).
```

As stated before, the else block is where the parent is the right child, and the uncle is the left child.  All of the logic is reversed (left is swapped for right).

To recap

1. Link a node into the tree just like you would with a binary search tree
2. Paint the node red
3. Start a forever loop
4. If the node doesn't have a parent, paint the node black and return
5. If the node's parent is black, return
6. If the node's uncle is not NULL and it is red
   a. paint the parent and the uncle black
   b. paint the grandparent red
   c. set the node to be the grandparent and continue in loop (3)
7. If the node is on the same side of the parent as the uncle is to the grandparent, rotate away from the uncle around the parent.
8. Rotate towards the uncle around the grandparent, swap colors with the parent and the grandparent, and return.

## Erase

Erasing nodes in a red black tree is more complex than insertion.  In writing this and trying to visualize what is happening, I needed to keep reminding myself of the importance of maintaining black height and to a lesser extent, the other rules (particularly that a node with only one child must have a red child).  Like insertion, node\_erase calls a function to fix the balance of the tree once the node is removed.  A key difference is that the color doesn't always have to be fixed.  Another difference is that what is fixed is either the parent or the successor.

The function replace\_node\_with\_child sets the child color to the node that it is replacing's color.
```c
child->color = node->color;
```

If there is one child or if the node is the last in the tree, the color doesn't need to be fixed.  The only case in the block below where a node needs fixed is if you erase a black node without any children that isn't the root.

```c
static void fix_color_for_erase(node_t *parent, node_t *node, node_t **root);

bool node_erase(node_t *node, node_t **root) {
  node_t *parent = node->parent;
  if(!node->left) {
    if(node->right)
      replace_node_with_child(node->right, node, root);
    else {
      if(parent) {
        if(parent->left == node)
          parent->left = NULL;
        else
          parent->right = NULL;
        if(node->color == BLACK)
          fix_color_for_erase(parent, NULL, root);
      }
      else
        *root = NULL;
    }
  }
  else if(!node->right)
    replace_node_with_child(node->left, node, root );
```

If you consider the following examples, it should be clear why erasing a red leaf is never a problem or a node with one child.

The tree\_operations has a -q feature which is less verbose (you don't get the menu or the list of operations that lead to a successful red-black tree structure).

```
$ $ac/bin/tree_operations -q ABC
B1
| \
|  (C1)
|      
(A1)

e A
B1
  \
   (C1)

The above tree is a valid red black tree.

e C
B1

The above tree is a valid red black tree
```

```
$ $ac/bin/tree_operations -q ABC
B1
| \
|  (C1)
|      
(A1)

e A
B1
  \
   (C1)

The above tree is a valid red black tree.

e B
C1

The above tree is a valid red black tree
```

The case where fixing the color is important is shown below.  A has no children and is black.
```
$ $ac/bin/tree_operations -q ABCD
B1
| \
A2 C2
     \
      (D2)

e A
B1
  \
   C2
     \
      (D2)

B1 has one right child, and it isn't red
```

The rest of the erase method is to consider cases where the node being erased has two children.  If the successor is to the right (it doesn't have any left children), it will replace the node to erase as usual.  If the successor has a right child, then its child color will change to black (from red).  We can be assured that the successor's right child is red because it is an only child.

```c
else {
  node_t *successor = node->right;
  if(!successor->left) {
    size_t color = successor->color;
    replace_node_with_child(successor, node, root);
    successor->left = node->left;
    successor->left->parent = successor;
    if(successor->right)
      successor->right->color = BLACK;
    else {
      if(color == BLACK)
        fix_color_for_erase(successor, NULL, root);
    }
  }
```

<b>An example where the successor has a right node:</b>  erasing F, G becomes successor, G has right child H.  

- Move G into F's spot.
- Color G's right child (H) black

<b>An example where the successor is black:</b> In this case, B is erased, C is the successor and is black.  C is colored the color of B.  The tree becomes invalid because C has a single black child (single children must be red).  The color must be fixed.

If the successor is to the left of the node to the right of the node to erase, then the normal erasing happens.  If the successor has a child, it would be right and red (because it would be the only child).  In this case, we replace the node that is going to be erased with both the successor and the successor that has the right child of the successor (in both cases, exchanging colors).  The node to the right of the successor will change to black because the successor started as black (because it only had one red child).
```c
    else {
      while(successor->left)
        successor = successor->left;

      size_t color = successor->color;
      node_t *right = successor->right;
      node_t *parent = successor->parent;
      parent->left = right;
      if(right) {
        right->color = BLACK;
        right->parent = parent;
        color = RED;
      }
      replace_node_with_child(successor, node, root);
      successor->left = node->left;
      successor->left->parent = successor;
      successor->right = node->right;
      successor->right->parent = successor;
      if(color == BLACK)
        fix_color_for_erase(parent, NULL, root);
    }
  }
  return true;
}
```

In the example below H is erased and replaced with its successor (I).  I has a right child M which becomes a child of N and is colored black.

The above tree is a valid red black tree

In the example below, H is erased (which is black) and replaced with I, which doesn't have a child.  The color must be fixed.

(N2) has one right child and it isn't red
```

In the example below, N is erased (which is red) and replaced with O, which doesn't have a right child.  Because N is red, O will be red, and the overall tree height will be maintained.  The red black tree properties remain valid.

## Quick recap of when tree becomes invalid
- The node to erase has no children, is black, and has a parent.  The node's parent is invalid.
- The node to erase has two children, the successor was originally black, and the successor did not have a right child.  The successor's original parent is invalid (this is the successor itself when the successor is to the right of the node\_to\_erase since it replaced its parent).

It's worth noting that when you erase a node and use a successor, that you are erasing the successor and putting it in place of the node to erase.  That's why in the first case, the parent of the node to erase is used, and in the second case, the parent of the successor is used.

## fix\_color\_for\_erase

```c
static void fix_color_for_erase(node_t *parent, node_t *node, node_t **root) {
  node_t *sibling;
  if(parent->right != node) {
    sibling = parent->right;
    if(sibling->color == RED) {
      rotate_left(parent, root);
      sibling = parent->right;
    }
    if(sibling->left) {
      if(sibling->right) {
        if(sibling->right->color == RED) {
          sibling->right->color = BLACK;
          rotate_left(parent, root);
        }
        else {
          if(sibling->left->color == RED) {
            rotate_right(sibling, root);
            rotate_left(parent, root);
            sibling->color = BLACK;
          }
          else {
            sibling->color = RED;
            if(parent->parent && parent->color == BLACK)
              fix_color_for_erase(parent->parent, parent, root);
            else
              parent->color = BLACK;
          }
        }
      }
      else {
        rotate_right(sibling, root);
        rotate_left(parent, root);
        sibling->color = BLACK;
      }
    } else if(sibling->right) {
      sibling->right->color = BLACK;
      rotate_left(parent, root);
    } else {
      sibling->color = RED;
      if(parent->parent && parent->color == BLACK)
        fix_color_for_erase(parent->parent, parent, root);
      else
        parent->color = BLACK;
    }
  }
  else {
    sibling = parent->left;
    if(sibling->color == RED) {
      rotate_right(parent, root);
      sibling = parent->left;
    }
    if(sibling->right) {
      if(sibling->left) {
        if(sibling->left->color == RED) {
          sibling->left->color = BLACK;
          rotate_right(parent, root);
        }
        else {
          if(sibling->right->color == RED) {
            rotate_left(sibling, root);
            rotate_right(parent, root);
            sibling->color = BLACK;
          }
          else {
            sibling->color = RED;
            if(parent->parent && parent->color == BLACK)
              fix_color_for_erase(parent->parent, parent, root);
            else
              parent->color = BLACK;
          }
        }
      }
      else {
        rotate_left(sibling, root);
        rotate_right(parent, root);
        sibling->color = BLACK;
      }
    } else if(sibling->left) {
      sibling->left->color = BLACK;
      rotate_right(parent, root);
    } else {
      sibling->color = RED;
      if(parent->parent && parent->color == BLACK)
        fix_color_for_erase(parent->parent, parent, root);
      else
        parent->color = BLACK;
    }
  }
}
```

The fix\_color\_for\_erase function is large but can split into sections that largely mirror each other.

```c
static void fix_color_for_erase(node_t *parent, node_t *node, node_t **root) {
  node_t *sibling;
  if(parent->right != node) {
    sibling = parent->right;
    ...
  }
  else {
    sibling = parent->left;
    ...
  }
}
```

The only difference between the if and the else statement is that every left and right are swapped.  The rest of the explanation will focus on where the sibling is on the right.

The insert color fixing method of the red black tree uses the uncle's color to help decide actions.  The erase color fixing method uses the sibling.  If the sibling is red, we can rotate away from the sibling around the parent and set the sibling to be the parent's right node.
```c
if(sibling->color == RED) {
  rotate_left(parent, root);
  sibling = parent->right;
}
```

In the example below, erase A, the sibling is O (which is red), and the parent is E:
```
$ $ac/bin/tree_operations -q AEIOUY
E1
| \
A2 (O1)
   |   \
   I2   U2
          \
           (Y2)

e A
E1
  \
   (O1)
   |   \
   I2   U2
          \
           (Y2)

E1 has a NULL left child with a different black height than I2

l E
O1
| \
|  U2
|    \
|     (Y2)
|         
(E1)
    \
     I2

(E1) has a NULL left child with a different black height than I2
(E1) has one right child and it isn't red
```

After the rotation, E becomes red, and I becomes the sibling that is black.  

To recap: if the sibling is red, rotate away from the sibling and set the sibling to be equal to what is on the same side of the parent again.  The sibling will be black, and we can proceed with the cases which expect the sibling to be black.
```c
if(sibling->right && sibling->right == RED) {
  sibling->right->color = BLACK;
  rotate_left(parent, root);  
}
else if(sibling->left && sibling->left == RED) {
  rotate_right(sibling, root);
  rotate_left(parent, root);
  sibling->color = BLACK;  
}
else {
  sibling->color = RED;
  if(parent->parent && parent->color == BLACK)
    fix_color_for_erase(parent->parent, parent, root);
  else
    parent->color = BLACK;  
}
```

<b>If the sibling is to the right and is black:</b>

First, check to see if the sibling's right child is red.  If it is, color it black and rotate left around the parent.
```c
if(sibling->right->color == RED) {
  sibling->right->color = BLACK;
  rotate_left(parent, root);
}
```

If not, check if the sibling's left child is red.  If it is, rotate right around the sibling, then left around the parent.  Finally, color the sibling black (the rotations will have changed the sibling's color).
```c
if(sibling->left->color == RED) {
  rotate_right(sibling, root);
  rotate_left(parent, root);
  sibling->color = BLACK;
}
```

Finally, if neither of the sibling's children are red, color the sibling red.  If the parent is red or is the root, color the parent black.  Otherwise, fix the color for the parent's parent and set the node to pair up with a sibling to be the parent.
```c
sibling->color = RED;
  if(parent->parent && parent->color == BLACK)
    fix_color_for_erase(parent->parent, parent, root);
  else
    parent->color = BLACK;
```

## Packing color into the parent node

The code for this section is found in <i>illustrations/12\_red\_black\_tree/2\_red\_black\_tree</i>
```
cd $ac/illustrations/12_red_black_tree/2_red_black_tree
make
```

The red\_black\_tree code above used the following node data structure.
```c
struct node_s {
  size_t color;
  struct node_s *parent;
  struct node_s *left;
  struct node_s *right;
  char key;
};
```

This requires 8 bytes (on a 64-bit machine) for the color and 8 bytes for the parent.  Since pointers to structures are typically aligned, we can use the 0 bit of the parent for the color and save 8 bytes per node structure.  Our new structure will look like.
```c
struct node_s {
  size_t parent_color;
  struct node_s *left;
  struct node_s *right;
  char key;
};
```

We can then use the following #define macros to access and set the parent node and the color.
```c
#define rb_color(n) ((n)->parent_color & 1)
#define rb_is_red(n) (((n)->parent_color & 1) == 0)
#define rb_is_black(n) (((n)->parent_color & 1) == 1)
#define rb_parent(n) (node_t *)((n)->parent_color - ((n)->parent_color & 1))

#define rb_set_black(n) (n)->parent_color |= 1
#define rb_set_red(n) (n)->parent_color -= ((n)->parent_color & 1)
#define rb_set_parent(n, parent) (n)->parent_color = ((n)->parent_color & 1) + (size_t)(parent)

#define rb_clear_black(n) (n)->parent_color = 1
```

The rest of the changes involve converting code that accesses the parent pointer or the color to one of these macros.  You can run the following command to find all of the diffs.  I'll show a few.
```
diff red_black_tree.c ../1_red_black_tree/red_black_tree.c | less
```

rb\_parent
```c
n = n->parent;
```

becomes
```c
n = rb_parent(n);
```

rb\_set\_red
```c
n->color = RED;
```

becomes
```c
rb_set_red(n);
```

rb\_is\_red
```c
if(n->color == RED)
```

becomes
```c
if(rb_is_red(n))
```

rb\_clear\_black
```c
n->parent = NULL;
n->color = BLACK;
```

becomes
```c
rb_clear_black(n);
```

and so on.
