## Getting Started

This first chapter covers setting up the computer for the projects in succeeding chapters. The following instructions execute in macOS Terminal, which holds consistent with Linux. However, Windows Command Line (now Terminal) may require some variation of the given commands.

Open the terminal (on a mac - `Command+Space` and type terminal)

Make sure you are in your home directory
```
cd
```

Optionally create a directory to place your code.
```
mkdir code
cd code
```

Clone the examples in this book into your newly created code directory
```
git clone https://github.com/contactandyc/another-c-library.git
```

Create an environment variable named ac (another c library) and make the variable available the next time you open the terminal. This command is sensitive to the shell program you are using. If you are running macOS 10.15 Catalina or newer, the default shell will be zsh
```
echo ac=`pwd`/another-c-library >> ~/.zshrc
```

Previous to this macOS release and on most Linux distributions, the default shell is bash
```
echo ac=`pwd`/another-c-library >> ~/.bashrc
```

Either close the terminal and reopen it, or run one of the following commands (depending on your shell) to ensure the last changes take effect
```
. ~/.zshrc
```

```
. ~/.bashrc
```

Change to the directory where the project exists
```
cd $ac
```

To test whether you have `make` and `gcc` installed (both requirements for this project).  Change the directory to the first example and then run `make`
```
cd $ac/illustrations/1_getting_started/1_test_setup
make
```

Output should be
```
Success!  You are now ready to continue with the rest of the examples in the book.
```

If an error occurs, use your favorite search engine and copy and paste the error and search for it. The answer will likely exist on sites like stackoverflow.com. These Internet resources did not exist when I began writing software. However, today, most errors are common. Just beware that the answers may be wrong, so you may need to look over a few answers. This project depends upon `gcc` and `make`. Post-installation, repeat the commands above (duplicated below) until you get the "Success!" message.

If you have changed directories, then you will need to rerun this.
```
cd $ac/illustrations/1_getting_started/1_test_setup
```

Run this command, and if you get the message afterward, you will be good to go.
```
make
```

```
Success!  You are now ready to continue with the rest of the examples in the book.
```

Throughout this book, I will often reference how to run a command with a dollar ($) preceding it, which indicates that you are at a command prompt. You should enter the text after the command, for example:

```
make
```

```
Success! You are now ready to continue with the rest of the examples in the book.
```

might be represented as
```
$ make
Success!  You are now ready to continue with the rest of the examples in the book.
```

Therefore, you should enter `make` at the command line and hit enter and expect the text "Success!..." if you are following along.

If you change to the directory
```
cd $ac/illustrations
```

and run

```
ls -l
```

you should see the following
```

```

For each chapter, there will be a number and name that corresponds to the chapter in this book.  For example, within <i>1\_getting\_started</i>, there is a folder named <i>1\_test\_setup</i>.
```
ls -l 1_getting_started
```

```
total 0
drwxr-xr-x  10 ac  staff  320 Sep 11 10:04 1_test_setup
```

The date and user will likely be different.  Each illustration is named based upon the general application and the order within the chapter.  I will often reference that code is in a given directory.  The expectation is that you would know how to change to that directory demonstrated below.

In the following, you would be expected to replace "<directory>" with the given directory
```
cd $ac/<directory>
```

For example, if the code was in <i>illustrations/1_getting_started/1_test_setup</i>, you would run the following command to change to the given directory.
```
cd $ac/illustrations/1_getting_started/1_test_setup
```

I would highly recommend going through tutorials if you are not familiar with the command line. Understanding the terminal is essential for any programmer. I do not plan on utilizing many terminal related commands but will try to detail the used commands.
