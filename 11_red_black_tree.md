# The Red Black Tree

The red black tree is a mostly balanced binary search tree that was invented by Leonidas J. Guibas and Robert Sedgewick.  To understand the red black tree, it is good to have a thorough understanding of [binary search trees](10_binary_search_trees.md) first.  

## Why do we need balanced binary search trees?

To start, let's explore why balancing a binary search tree is important.

The following code is found in <i>illustrations/11_red_black_tree/1_binary_search_tree</i>
```bash
cd $stla/illustrations/11_red_black_tree/1_binary_search_tree
```

```bash
make
```

In this case, I've not included examples in the Makefile.  I've also commented out printing the data structure using iteration and reverse iteration as it isn't relevant to understanding how the red black tree works.

To understand why balancing a binary search tree is important, let's look at some worst case and bad scenarios.

One worst case scenario
```bash
$ ./test_data_structure ABCDEFGHI
Creating binary_search_tree for ABCDEFGHI
A1
  \
   B2
     \
      C3
        \
         D4
           \
            E5
              \
               F6
                 \
                  G7
                    \
                     H8
                       \
                        I9
```

Another worst case scenario
```bash
$ ./test_data_structure IHGFEDCBA
Creating binary_search_tree for IHGFEDCBA
I1
|
H2
|
G3
|
F4
|
E5
|
D6
|
C7
|
B8
|
A9
```


A mixed case where the tree isn't balanced
```bash
$ ./test_data_structure IHGFEDCBAabcdef
Creating binary_search_tree for IHGFEDCBAabcdef
I1
| \
H2 a2
|    \
G3    b3
|       \
F4       c4
|          \
E5          d5
|             \
D6             e6
|                \
C7                f7
|                   
B8
|
A9
```

Yet another worst case scenario.
```bash
$ ./test_data_structure Izpagkml
Creating binary_search_tree for Izpagkml
I1
  \
   z2
   |
   p3
   |
   a4
     \
      g5
        \
         k6
           \
            m7
            |
            l8
```

The example above could be said to be balanced if it looked like the following.

```
k1
| \
|  p2
|  | \
|  m3 z3
|  |    
|  l4
|    
a2
| \
I3 g3
```

The leaf nodes are the nodes which don't have children.  In the example above, all of the leaves have a depth of 3, except l which has a depth of 4.  At the first level of a binary search tree, a fully balanced tree can have at most 1 node (the root node).  At the second level, 2 nodes (+1 for the first level).  At the third level, 4 nodes (+3 for the first and second), and so on.  The example above has 8 nodes and the entire first, second, and third levels are full.  This tree is balanced.

A balanced binary search tree is useful in that you are guaranteed that finding a node will take O(logN) time where N is the number of elements in the tree.  A binary search tree that isn't balanced has a worst case of O(N) time.  This isn't a big deal if you have 5-10 nodes, but if you have 1 million nodes, a balanced binary search tree will take at most 21 operations.  If the tree is not balanced, it might take 1 million operations!  You will often see logN used in describing how long an algorithm takes.  The base of log in this case is 2 (since computers think in terms of 0s and 1s or powers of 2).

## The properties of a red black tree

Red–black tree Properties (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red–black_tree)

1. Each node is either red or black.
2. The root is black.
3. All leaves (NIL) are black.
4. If a node is red, then both its children are black.
5. Every path from a given node to any of its descendant NIL nodes contains the
  same number of black nodes.

My additional rules for clarification which are based upon the first 5 rules.
- If a node has one child, the child must be red
- If a node has two children, one or both of the children can be red if the parent is black
- If a node is red, it must have either two children which are black or no children at all.
- The parent of a red node must be black
- The black height of any leaf node must be the same (another way of stating 5)
- A red black tree often will have many more black nodes than red nodes.  This is okay and expected.  The red node is an indication that the tree may be somehow out of balance.  It is possible to have more red nodes than black nodes, but it isn't typical.
- A red black tree has a worst case of a 2logN depth, but is likely to maintain a logN depth or be very close to it.

## Building an intuition for how red black trees work

To begin, let's look at a few red black trees.  Markdown doesn't support printing color in code blocks, so the red nodes are not colored.  They are colored if you follow along in the terminal.  In order to accommodate, red nodes are suffixed with an r.  One of the rules for a red black tree is that all of the leaf nodes must have the same black height.  Instead of printing the depth of a node, I'm printing the black depth (or black height) of the nodes.  Black height can be calculated by simply counting the number of black nodes in the path to the root.


The following code is found in <i>illustrations/11_red_black_tree/2_red_black_tree</i>
```bash
cd $stla/illustrations/11_red_black_tree/2_red_black_tree
```

```bash
make
```

```bash
$ ./test_data_structure ABC
Creating red_black_tree for ABC
B1
| \
|  C1r
|     
A1r
```

The black height of A and C are 1 because there is one black node in their path to the root (B).

```bash
$ ./test_data_structure ABCDEFGH
Creating red_black_tree for ABCDEFGH
D1
| \
|  F1r
|  |  \
|  E2  G2
|        \
B1r       H2r
|  \         
A2  C2
```

- The black height of A is 2 because A and D are black.  
- The black height of H is 2 because G and D are black.  
- The black height of all of the leaf nodes are 2.  
- H is the only child of G and because of that H is red.
- Because H is red, G is black.
- F and B are red and have two black children.
- H is red and has no children.
- D is the root, so it is black.

```bash
$ ./test_data_structure GERMANY
Creating red_black_tree for GERMANY
G1
| \
E2 N1r
|  |  \
|  M2  R2
|        \
A2r       Y2r
```

- The black height of the leaf nodes is 2.
- N is red, so both of its children are black.
- Y and A are only children, so they are red.
- G is the root, so it is black.

If you think about removing nodes, you can remove A and Y, making E and R leaf nodes, without affecting black height equality.
```bash
G1
| \
E2 N1r
   |  \
   M2  R2
```

If you remove M
```bash
G1
| \
E2 N1r
      \
      R2
```

- E and R have a black height of 2, so the height is okay
- R is an only child, but is black (wrong)
- N is red and only has one black child (wrong)

If we could swap the colors of N and R, we would have a valid red black tree as the only child R would be red.
```bash
G1
| \
E2 N2
     \
      R2r
```

We could also rotate R to the left through N and get

```bash
G1
| \
E2 R2
   |
   N2r
```

Typically when a node is rotated, the color remains the same of the node that is being rotated through (which ends up also being a color swap).  

## Rotations

The red black tree is balanced through rotations and changing colors.  The following examples will not include colors and are just made up.  A right rotation around R

```bash
G
|\
E R
  |
  N
```

would result in
```bash
G
|\
E R
   \
    N
```

A left rotation around G would result in
```bash
R
|\
G N
|
E
```

A right rotation around G would result in
```bash
R
|\
E N
 \
  G
```

In all cases after a rotation, the tree is still a valid binary search tree.

The implementation of the right rotation looks like the following.

```c
void rotate_right(node_t *A, node_t **root) {
  node_t *new_root = A->left;
  _swap_nodes(new_root, A, root);

  node_t *tmp = new_root->right;
  new_root->right = A;
  A->parent = new_root;

  A->left = tmp;
  if(A->left)
    A->left->parent = A;
}
```

When rotating to the right, the left node will become the parent and the current parent will move to the right of the parent.  

If the parent's parent is the root node, the parent's parent must relink to the left node.  Otherwise, the parent is the root node, the left node will become the new root node.  This is done through _swap_nodes.

```c
static inline void _swap_nodes(node_t *dest,
                               node_t *src,
                               node_t **root) {
  node_t *parent = src->parent;
  if(parent) {
    if(parent->left == src)
      parent->left = dest;
    else
      parent->right = dest;
    dest->parent = parent;
  }
  else {
    dest->parent = NULL;
    *root = dest;
  }
}
```

The old left node (which has become the parent) assigns its right pointer to the old parent node.  The parent of the old parent is set to the old left node.
```c
node_t *tmp = new_root->right;
new_root->right = A;
A->parent = new_root;
```

If the left node had a right child, that would have been saved in tmp.  Assign this to the left of the old parent.  If tmp was not NULL, set its parent to the old parent.
```c
A->left = tmp;
if(tmp)
  tmp->parent = A;
```

Rotating to the left is the same as rotating to the right, except you swap the words left and right in the explanation and code above.  For completeness, the two functions are included below.

```c
void rotate_right(node_t *A, node_t **root) {
  node_t *new_root = A->left;
  _swap_nodes(new_root, A, root);

  node_t *tmp = new_root->right;
  new_root->right = A;
  A->parent = new_root;

  A->left = tmp;
  if(tmp)
    tmp->parent = A;
}
```

```c
void rotate_left(node_t *A, node_t **root) {
  node_t *new_root = A->right;
  _swap_nodes(new_root, A, root);

  node_t *tmp = new_root->left;
  new_root->left = A;
  A->parent = new_root;

  A->right = tmp;
  if(tmp)
    tmp->parent = A;
}
```

The differences are...
```c
void rotate_right(node_t *A, node_t **root) {
  node_t *new_root = A->left;
```

to
```c
void rotate_left(node_t *A, node_t **root) {
  node_t *new_root = A->right;
```

These lines change from
```c
new_root->right = A;
A->parent = new_root;
```

to
```c
node_t *tmp = new_root->left;
new_root->left = A;
```

The last change is
```c
A->left = tmp;
```

to
```c
A->right = tmp;
```

Notice that the change is literally to swap the words left and right.

During most of the rotations, you will also need to swap colors.
```c
void rotate_right_and_swap_colors(node_t *A, node_t **root) {
  size_t tmp = A->color;
  A->color = A->left->color;
  A->left->color = tmp;
  rotate_right(A, root);
}

void rotate_left_and_swap_colors(node_t *A, node_t **root) {
  size_t tmp = A->color;
  A->color = A->right->color;
  A->right->color = tmp;
  rotate_left(A, root);
}
```

These functions swap colors and then do the rotation.

## Insert

The red black tree functions in many ways similar to the binary search tree.  Iterating and finding are exactly the same.  Erasing and inserting are done in virtually the same way, except once an item is inserted or erased, the color must be fixed.  The difference between the binary search tree and red black tree node_insert is shown below.

binary_search_tree.c
```c
bool node_insert(node_t *node_to_insert, node_t **root) {
  node_t **n = root, *parent = NULL;
  while (*n) {
    parent = *n;
    if (node_to_insert->key < parent->key)
      n = &(parent->left);
    else if (node_to_insert->key > parent->key)
      n = &(parent->right);
    else
      return false;
  }

  node_to_insert->parent = parent;
  node_to_insert->left = node_to_insert->right = NULL;
  *n = node_to_insert;
  return true;
}
```

red_black_tree.c
```c
void red_black_insert(node_t *node, node_t **root);

bool node_insert(node_t *node_to_insert, node_t **root) {
  node_t **n = root, *parent = NULL;
  while (*n) {
    parent = *n;
    if (node_to_insert->key < parent->key)
      n = &(parent->left);
    else if (node_to_insert->key > parent->key)
      n = &(parent->right);
    else
      return false;
  }

  node_to_insert->parent = parent;
  *n = node_to_insert;
  red_black_insert(node_to_insert, root);
  return true;
}
```

The difference is..

binary_search_tree.c
```c
node_to_insert->left = node_to_insert->right = NULL;
```

red_black_tree.c
```c
void red_black_insert(node_t *node, node_t **root);
...
red_black_insert(node_to_insert, root);
```

The red_black_insert method in red_black_tree.c
```c
void red_black_insert(node_t *node, node_t **root) {
  node->left = node->right = NULL;
  node->color = RED;
  node_t *parent, *grandparent, *uncle;

  while (true) {
    parent = node->parent;
    if(!parent) {
      node->parent = NULL;
      node->color = BLACK;
      break;
    }

    if(parent->color == BLACK)
      break;

    grandparent = parent->parent;
    if(grandparent->left == parent) {
      uncle = grandparent->right;
      if(uncle && uncle->color == RED) {
        grandparent->color = RED;
        parent->color = uncle->color = BLACK;
        node = grandparent;
        continue;
      }

      if(parent->right == node)
        rotate_left(parent, NULL);
      rotate_right_and_swap_colors(grandparent, root);
      break;
    }
    else {
      uncle = grandparent->left;
      if(uncle && uncle->color == RED) {
        grandparent->color = RED;
        parent->color = uncle->color = BLACK;
        node = grandparent;
        continue;
      }

      if(parent->left == node)
        rotate_right(parent, NULL);
      rotate_left_and_swap_colors(grandparent, root);
      break;
    }
  }
}
```

The red_black_insert sets the left and right pointers to NULL at the top of the function (so this part is similar).

It is assumed that node is linked into its proper parent and that the node is a leaf node.  The red black tree always initially paints the given node red.
```c
void red_black_insert(node_t *node, node_t **root) {
  node->left = node->right = NULL;
  node->color = RED;
```

The insert operation will need to look at the parent, the grandparent, and the uncle (the sibling of the parent).  Declare these variables for later use.
```c
  node_t *parent, *grandparent, *uncle;
```

The red black tree insert may need to recurse.  Many recursion problems (this one included) can be written as a loop.  The loop will continue forever until a break is called.  
```c
while (true) {
  parent = node->parent;
```
At this point in the code, the node is always red.

The first check is to see if the given node is the root node.  If the node doesn't have a parent, it is a root node.  Root nodes are colored black and then we are done (break out of the while loop).    
```c
  if(!parent) {
    node->parent = NULL;
    node->color = BLACK;
    break;
  }
```

If the parent is black we are done as having a red leaf following a black parent is always valid.
```c
  if(parent->color == BLACK)
    break;
```

The parent is valid and it must be red (as it must be red or black and it was determined to not be black in the last block of code).  It is a violation of the red black tree to have two red nodes in a row.  Get the grandparent (the parent's parent).
```c
  grandparent = parent->parent;
```

The red black tree insert operation consider's the node's uncle's color.  The uncle would be the grandparent's other child.  If the grandparent->left == parent, then the uncle is the right node.  Otherwise, the uncle is the left node.  The else block is a mirror of the if block, switching every instance of left with right.
```c
  if(grandparent->left == parent) {
    uncle = grandparent->right;
    ...
  }
  else {
    uncle = grandparent->left;
    ...
  }
```

The next case to test is if the uncle exists and the uncle's color is red.  At this point the parent and the uncle are both red.  The red black tree needs to maintain a constant black height.

```
           F
         /   \
        D     G
      /   \
     Br    Er
    /
   Ar
```

Prior to inserting node Ar which is red, notice that the leaf nodes Br, Er, and G all have a black height of 2 meaning that there are only 2 black nodes in the path from the root to each of the leaf nodes.  If you recolor Br and Er black and change B to be red, it doesn't change the black height of any of the leaf nodes.

```
           F
         /   \
        Dr    G
      /   \
     B     E
    /
   Ar
```

Notice that in this case, the recoloring created a valid red black tree.  The black height is 2 to every leaf node.  The root is black.  There are not two red nodes in a row.  In the one case where a node only has a single child, the child is red.

To recap, if the parent and uncle are red, paint the parent and uncle black and the grandparent red.  It's possible that the grandparent's parent was also red.  To handle this case, we can repeat all of the tests recursively (since the recursion is simple, continuing in a while loop works by changing the node to the grandparent - which was painted red to maintain the rule that the loop always starts with a red node).

```c
  if(grandparent->left == parent) {
    uncle = grandparent->right;
    if(uncle && uncle->color == RED) {
      grandparent->color = RED;
      parent->color = uncle->color = BLACK;
      node = grandparent;
      continue;
    }
```

The next case is if the uncle is black or NULL, then rotate to the right around the grandparent.  Notice that while swapping colors during the rotate, that the placement of the black node doesn't change. This maintains the proper black height.

Do a right rotation on D to the following
```
           F
         /   \
        D     G
      /  
     Br  
    /
   Ar
```

to become
```
           F
         /   \
        B     G
      /  \
     Ar   Dr
```

If Br was the right child of the parent (Ar), then do an extra left rotation on Ar to make the tree look like the case above before doing the right rotation (there's no need for color swapping because they're both red).
```
           F
         /   \
        D     G
      /  
     Ar  
       \
        Br
```

becomes
```
           F
         /   \
        D     G
      /  
     Br  
    /
   Ar
```

which is the case we had before, so we can do a right rotation on D to become
```
           F
         /   \
        B     G
      /  \
     Ar   Dr
```

The code looks like the following
```c
  if(parent->right == node)
    rotate_left(parent, NULL);
  rotate_right_and_swap_colors(grandparent, root);
  break;
```

As stated before the else block is where the parent is the right child and the uncle is the left child.  All of the logic is reversed (left is swapped for right).

To recap

1. Link a node into the tree just like you would with a binary search tree
2. Paint the node red
3. Start a loop
4. If the node doesn't have a parent, paint the node black and return
5. If the node's parent is black, return
6. If the node's uncle is not NULL and it is red
   a. paint the parent and the uncle black
   b. paint the grandparent red
   c. set the node to be the grandparent and continue in loop (3)
7. If the node is on the same side of the parent as the uncle is to the grandparent, rotate away from the uncle around the parent.
8. Rotate towards the uncle around the grandparent, swap colors with the parent and the grandparent, and return.

## Erase

Erasing nodes in a red black tree is more complex than insertion.  In writing this and trying to visualize what is happening, I needed to keep reminding myself of the importance of maintaining black height and to a lesser extent the other rules (particularly that a node with only one child must have a red child).

Because of the complexity of this, I'm writing out the rules first.

1. If the node has no children and no parent, then this is the last node in the tree and *root is set to NULL.
2. If a node has a single child, then that child must be red and the given node to erase must be black.  This is the simplest case in that you only need to swap the red child of the node to erase with the node to erase by linking the red child to the node to erase's parent.  To maintain the black height, the red child's color will change to black.

```bash
  A
   \
    Br
```

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;becomes
```bash
  B
```

3. If the node has no children or the node has two black children, then unlink the node from it's parent.  If the node itself was black, this causes the parent to be double-black and requires that the color be fixed.  A node is considered double-black if in the process of removing the node, you lose the ability to maintain a constant black height.  In the process of removing a node, there will be at most one double-black node, so that node can be fixed through rotations and recoloring (to be discussed in a bit). Imagine if we removing N, then B would be the only child of A so B must be red which would cause the rest of the tree to not necessarily maintain a constant black height.  Instead of changing B to red, A is marked double black and then the color needs to be fixed.
```bash
          A           A (double-black)
         / \    =>   /
        B   N       B
```

4.  To erase a node in a binary tree when the node to erase has two children, you must find the successor.  The successor is defined as the leftmost node to the right child.  One reasonably obvious feature of choosing the successor to replace the node to erase is that it will not have a left child.  This makes the replacement easy in as much as you can link the node to erase's left child to the successor without having to worry about it's previous left child (since it doesn't have one).  This presents four scenarios (lettered a, b, c, and d).  The first two scenarios happen if the right child of the node doesn't have a left child, then the right child is the successor.  In this case, the successor is promoted its parent (the node to erase).  The color of the successor and the node to erase are swapped (so during the swap if the node to erase was red, then the successor will become red and vice versa).

       a) If there is a right child to the successor, then the successor must
          be black (because the right child is an only child and must be red).

        N
         \
          S
           \
            sR (successor right child)

        becomes

        S
         \
          SR

        The other case here is that the node to erase is red.  In this case,
        the following happens.

        n
         \
          S
           \
            sR (successor right child)

        becomes

        s
         \
          SR

        In both cases, the black height is maintained.  In both cases,
        color is maintained at the given tree height.  The top node stays
        the color that it was and the successor's right child becomes black.


       N
        \
         s

       becomes

       S

       N
        \
         s
          \
           sR (successor right child)

       becomes

       S
        \
         SR

       In both cases, black height is maintained.

       b) If the node to erase is red and the successor does not have a right
       child, the successor becomes double-black and needs fixed as we have
       lost one black node in the tree.

       n
        \
         S

       becomes

       n

       with a black node being removed, so n must be fixed.

       If the node to erase was black, the following would happen.

       N
        \
         S

       becomes

       N

       again resulting in a black node being removed, so N must be fixed.



   5.  If the right child of the node does have a left child, traverse the
       left nodes until a node without a left node is found.  This is the
       successor.  The successor will have at most one right child which
       will be red by definition (because any single child is red).

       a) The successor has a right child.  In this case, the successor is
       removed from the tree like case 2 above by simply linking the leaf
       node (successor's right child to the successor's parent).  Once this
       is done, the successor will replace the node to erase.  It will take on
       the node to erase's left, right, parent, and color, and link the nodes
       to the left, right, and parent to the successor node instead of the
       node to erase.

           N (or n)
            \
             A
            /
           B
          /
         C
          \
           d

        becomes

            N (or n)
             \
              A
             /
            B
           /
          D

        with C removed

        The C and N or n are swapped.

           C (or c)
            \
             A
            /
           B
          /
         D

        b) The successor does not have a right child (or any children).  If C
        is black, then the black height will change when C is taken out and
        put in place of N.

            N (or n)
             \
              A
             /
            B
           /
          C

        becomes
            C (or c)
             \
              A
             /
            B

        B is double-black and needs fixed since C was black.  If C was red,
        then B will be black and okay.  The removal of C from B is like
        case 3 above where fixing the parent node (B) is necessary if B's
        child (C) is black.
