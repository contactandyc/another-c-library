	 Notice that a temporary link to the next node to erase is saved prior to destroying the node.  For binary search trees, the beginning to the end isn't the same as a sorted order.  It's known as postorder iteration.  Post order iteration can be useful for fast construction and destruction of binary search trees.  By having an alternate iterator for destruction, we can have one interface which works for a number of data structure types.
