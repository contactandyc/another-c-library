# Explanation of code

```c
#include "another-c-library/ac_io.h"
```
Include ac_io for ac_io_read_file

```c
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
```
The main entry point of the program. It accepts command-line arguments via `argc` (argument count) and `argv` (argument values).

```c
if (argc < 2) {
    printf("%s <input>\n", argv[0]);
    return -1;
}
```
This block ensures that at least one argument is provided (in addition to the program name itself). If not, it prints a usage message and exits with a return code of -1.

```c
size_t length;
char *buffer = ac_io_read_file(&length, argv[1]);
```
Here, a buffer is allocated to hold the contents of the file specified by the first command-line argument (`argv[1]`). The function `ac_io_read_file` reads the file and stores its length in the `length` variable. The buffer now contains the contents of the file.  ac_io_read_file appends a `\0` zero character to the end of the buffer. 

```c
if(buffer) {
    printf( "%s", buffer );
    ac_free(buffer);
}
```
This block checks if the buffer was successfully allocated (i.e., the file was read successfully). If so, it prints the contents of the buffer to standard output using `printf` and then frees the memory allocated for the buffer using the `ac_free` function.

```c
return 0;
}
```
The program successfully terminates with a return code of 0.

# Running the example program

Dump the sample.txt file to standard output.

```bash
% ./read_file_into_buffer sample.txt
Line 1: This is the first record.
Line 2: This is the second record.
Line 3: This is the third record.
Line 4: This is the fourth record.
Line 5: This is the fifth record.
```

# Summary

This code provides a simple command-line utility that reads a file specified by the user and prints its contents to the standard output. 

NOTE: ac_io_read_file does not decompress gz or lz4 files.
