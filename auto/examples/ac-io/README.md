# read-file-into-buffer

This code provides a simple command-line utility that reads a file specified by the user and prints its contents to the standard output.

# read-line-by-line

The program is designed to read and write files, including those compressed with lz4 or zlib formats. It uses the ac_in and ac_out libraries to handle input and output, seamlessly adapting to different file extensions to manage compression and decompression. The program can read from a specified input file and write to either a specified output file or standard output, all while accommodating different file formats and compression techniques.
